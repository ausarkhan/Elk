# PR: Feature - new branch for follow-up work (2025-11-05)

This branch was created from `main` to stage follow-up changes for review.

- Purpose: Provide a place to iterate on follow-up tasks (tests, CI tweaks, small fixes).
- Note: Movie implementation and tests exist on previous branches; this branch is a staging
  branch and may be updated with additional commits before merging.

Please review the branch and advise which changes you'd like included.
